Medical Context:  The treating physician has diagnosed the patient with Autism Spectrum Disorder and has explicitly prescribed Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy and Occupational Therapy (OT) as medically necessary interventions to aid development and functionality.     My Queries:  Could you please clarify the following regarding the AV Global Health Plan:     Coverage Confirmation: Are ABA Therapy and Occupational Therapy covered under the OPD (Outpatient Department) or a specific "Developmental Disorder" clause in this corporate policy?     Claim Process: Is this available on a cashless basis at network centers, or is it strictly on a reimbursement basis?     Documentation: If covered, please list the specific documents required to process these claims (e.g., Doctor\u2019s prescription, therapy session logs, invoices with specific breakdown).     Limits/Capping: Is there a specific sub-limit or session cap for these therapies under this policy number?',

CX wants to know the coverage if it will get covered or not so that he can go to hospital and make the bills under baby's name. We have suggested CX to directly raise the claim from app but he is disagreeing with the info and saying that he wants confirmation first for the coverage and then he will go to hospital and do the further process. So kindly please review and confirm the coverage details for these charges.

        "Note pushed from #14303630   \n \n Hi Team, \n   \n CX has raised a reimbursement claim in which the deductions are made for the pedriatrician charges and cx is saying that those charges were for baby so now if he wants to cover these charges can he raise the claim under baby's name and will these charges be claimable as in his policy baby is covered from day one. CX wants to know the coverage if it will get covered or not so that he can go to hospital and make the bills under baby's name. We have suggested CX to directly raise the claim from app but he is disagreeing with the info and saying that he wants confirmation first for the coverage and then he will go to hospital and do the further process. So kindly please review and confirm the coverage details for these charges. \n   \n Claim id- 25120500068-1 || UHID- ACK.7910CE20250568.1 || Mobile no- 9629857048 \n  \n \n  \n Regards, \n Chandni Muchhadia \n Customer service team\u00a0 \n \n\u00a0\n \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n \n    \nBEWARE OF FRAUDULENT CALLS AND OFFERS.

        'Dear Ravi,     We hope you\'re doing well.     This guide outlines the steps for a policyholder to manually disable the auto-renewal feature (unsubscribe from auto-pay) for their Acko policy via the website or mobile web interface.  Please guide the customer to perform the following steps:      Open Acko Website: Navigate to the official Acko website or mobile web.  Log In: Log in to their account using the registered mobile number or credentials.  Go to Policy Details: Find and open the specific policy details page for the vehicle they wish to stop auto-renewal for.  Disable Renewal: Scroll down towards the bottom of the policy details page and look for the option to "Unsubscribe renewal" or "Disable auto-pay" and click it to confirm.   By following these steps, the auto-renewal for the policy will be disabled, ensuring the customer is not automatically charged.     Need further assistance? You can reply to this email with your query and we\u2019ll be happy to help you.

        'Hi Ali,   This is regarding your ACKO Health policy renewal.   We would like to inform you that the IRDAI has allowed insurers to adjust premium prices to account for the increasing medical inflation. This adjustment is necessary to ensure that insurance companies can continue to provide adequate coverage and support to their customers.   There has been a change in regulations introduced by IRDAI in 2024 (refer to the\u00a0link attached, page 24, "(3) Review of insurance products:" section), which allows insurers to review prices and hike premiums as per changes in portfolio experience.   In compliance with regulatory changes and to account for the rising medical costs, we have revised our premium rates. These regulatory updates are outlined in the\u00a0Master Circular on Health Insurance Business of IRDAI dated 29.05.2024.   We understand that this change may have an impact on your policy, and we want to assure you that we are committed to providing you with the best possible coverage and support, backed by a high claim settlement ratio, an extensive cashless hospital network, and enhanced customer support to ensure a seamless and reliable experience.   Need further assistance? You can reply to this email with your query, and we\u2019ll be happy to help you. Alternatively, you may contact us on our toll-free number: 1800 266 2256.
